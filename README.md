# Topic Modeling on Amazon Phone and Accessories Reviews using NLP

## Introduction

Online shopping now makes our life much easier than it used to be.  Without the need of going out and visting a shopping mall or a grocery store, we can buy anything we want through e-shopping. 

But online shopping comes with its own caveats. One of the biggest challenges, and I guess almost every would face, is verifying the authenticity of a product. Is it as good as advertised on the e-commerce site? Will the product has a good quality? Are the reviews given by other customers really true or are they false advertising, or are they fake or bots' reviews? These are important questions customers need to ask before splurging their money.

## Importance of online reviews

I believe there are a bunch of people like me, who believe in customers' reviews much much more than the fancy product description of an item. In making our decision in buying a product, if most customers' reviews talking about how good it is, then it is probably a really good product. If every customer talks bad about a product, I am afraid I will not buy it no matter how good it shows me in the product description. And in some funny cases, which is quite often from my perspective, some users like to leave a high rating or score no matter how bad they think the product is. Oh god, this is tricky!
